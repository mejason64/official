				<p>Flint knapping is a way of processing stone into tools. Functional tools, like knives, arrows, projectile points,gravers,cutting edges and countless other items. Basically though, it's the process of making a sharp cutting edge or something that you can butcher an animal with. Flint knapping was an important skill that was used on every contient. Our ancestors all used this method of creating tools no matter where they came from.</p>



			

			<h2><strong>Tools used in in Flint Knapping:</strong></h2>

			<p>Many types of objects where used in the process of flint knapping. A good rounded stone, one having some heft, but not to heavy would be a good striker. An igneous rock works best, but any non-sandstone rock will do</p>

					<li>A deer antler tine pressure flaker or a copper tipped one. These will be used for final edge work.<em><a href="https://create-cdn.net/siteimages/31/2/4/312439/76/7/5/7675159/400x400.jpg?1385668949">See pic</a></em></li>

					<li>Medium sized antler baton.<em><a href= "http://www.sunjournal.com/files/imagecache/story_large/2011/04/17/BSECknap2P050111.jpg">See pic</a></em></li>

					<li>A few hammerstones of various sizes, egg shaped. One about 1 1/2 inches long and one about 2 1/2 inches long.<em><a href= "http://www.arrowheadology.com/forums/attachments/typology/62014d1317263181-flint-knapping-stones-phpune5ispm.jpg">See pic</a></em></li>

					<li>An abrader. Either of hard sandstone or a manufactured one.<em><a href= "http://www.goknapping.com/img-silica_abraider.jpg">See pic</a></em></li>
				</ul>

					<p>These are the only tools you really need in order to flintknap and I have found that these are the ones I rely on over and over again. They could fit in shaving bag or could be rolled up into a small leather parfleche and take up hardly any room at all.

					Later on you may find that once in a long while you'll have need of a larger billet for spalling or something, but hey -- try a rock. They're free and lots of abo knappers used them. I think there was probably a lot more hammerstone knappers than we realize in prehistoric times. With practice you'll be surprised how well you can remove flakes with stone tools.

					Bottom line: You don't have to break your bank account trying to buy every new tool under the sun in order to turn out beautiful points. </p>
