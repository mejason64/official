	<h2><strong>Microsoft Patents Ones and Zeroes</strong></h2>

	<h3><em>Unexpected development shakes up computer industry</em></h3>

	<p><strong>REDMOND, WA:</strong> In what CEO Bill Gates called an unfortunate but necessary step to protect our intellectual property from theft and exploitation by competitors, the Microsoft Corporation patented the numbers one and zero Monday.</p>

	<p>With the patent, Microsoft's rivals are prohibited from manufacturing of selling products containing zeroes and ones unless a royalty fee of 10 cents per digit used is paid to the software giant.</p>

	<p>Some other patents that Microsoft owns:</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Windows Vista</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Microsoft Office</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Xbox 360</strong></li>
	</ul>

<h2>Lucrative New Oil Extraction Method Involves Drilling Directly Into Gas Stations</h2>

<p><strong>IRVING, TX:</strong> Hailing it as a rapidly replenishable and easily accessible fuel source, ExxonMobil revealed a lucrative new oil extraction method Friday that involves drilling directly into gas stations. “We’ve found nearly unlimited reserves of highly refined petroleum mere meters beneath thousands of service stations across the country,” said ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson, noting that the company had already erected oil extraction rigs alongside pump islands in all 50 states. “As I speak, we’re yielding 3 million barrels per day just by boring through a few thin layers of asphalt, concrete, and metal. And, amazingly enough, the supply seems to somehow refill itself every week.” Tillerson went on to say that the company was exploring the possibility that there were still massive untapped sources of oil already in Americans’ cars, as well as in their homes.</p>

<h2><strong>Scientists Speculate Extraterrestrials</strong> May Have Completely Different Hair Than Humans</h2>

<h3>Scientists say alien civilizations could potentially favor updos completely unfathomable to the human mind.</h3>

<p><strong>PALO ALTO, CA:</strong> Citing the near infinite number of celestial bodies in the known universe, an international panel of scientists at Stanford University released a report this week speculating that any extraterrestrials that exist may have hair entirely different from that of humans.</p>

<p>The researchers, who analyzed data on the vast variety of atmospheric and chemical conditions found on distant worlds, suggested aliens could have hair with color and texture so different from that of human beings as to be virtually unrecognizable.</p>

<p>“When you consider just how massive the universe is and just how many ways life could have evolved, it’s likely extraterrestrials have hair we simply don’t have the vocabulary to describe,” said astrobiologist Jeremy Rosenwald, adding that a range of factors, such as the amount of gravity or water on a planet, could influence our very definition of silky, kinky, or wavy. “After all, alien hair could be an adaptation to literally any imaginable environment. If we encountered an alien tomorrow, who knows what hair we’d be dealing with?”</p>

<p>“Think of it,” Rosenwald continued. “Styling beyond the human brain’s capacity to even conceive.”</p>

<p>Researchers used computer simulations to predict how hair might develop in a variety of extreme planetary conditions, including severe cold, sustained wind speeds in excess of 2,000 miles per hour, or the absence of an atmosphere altogether. Among their findings was reportedly the startling revelation that alien life forms might not only have brown, black, blond, or red hair, but hair whose natural color falls literally anywhere along the visual spectrum—or that is completely translucent.</p>

<h1><strong>The Basics Of Test Automation For Apps, Games And The Mobile Web</strong></h1>

<h2>By Ville-Veikko Helppi</h2>

	<p>Mobile application ecosystems — let’s count Android and iOS here — are unbelievably dynamic, but they also suffer from both software and hardware fragmentation. This is especially true for Android, but fragmentation also exists in the iOS ecosystem, as experienced with the rollout of iOS 8. As the latest version of iOS was released, many existing apps were made clumsy on updated devices.</p>

	<p>Even the new iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus have had not-so-typical issues for Apple devices. In addition, a significant proportion of users with older devices have very few options: essentially, buy new hardware (i.e. a new device) to get everything working well.</p>

	<p>In the Android world, things are different. As OEMs launch new devices, software updates and customizations for their devices, application and game developers get serious headaches trying to keep their latest products up to snuff and fully compatible with all possible device variants. Making a certain app or game work only on high-end devices is out of the question, though. Why would a developer want to miss out on a significant chunk of potential users?</p>

	Automation enables simultaneous testing on hundreds of real devices. (Image credit: Testdroid) (View large version)

	<p>Professional automated testing software is a solution to a common problem: how to produce high-quality, robust and reliable software with the ever-growing complexity of technology and under massive competitive pressure. <strong>Automated software testing is a cost-effective solution</strong> to this problem. Not to mention, it provides three business benefits:</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><strong>increased testing efficiency</strong></li>
		<li><strong>increased testing effectiveness</strong></li>
		<li><strong>faster time to market</strong></li>
	</ul>

	<p>This article walks through a sample use case for test automation and provides a downloadable example to get you started. Also, we’ll focus on different aspects of mobile test automation and explain how this relatively new yet popular topic can help mobile app and game developers to build better, more robust products for consumers. With the advanced example later in the article, we’ll show how image recognition can be used to test mobile games; specifically, we’ll run Appium’s test automation framework against Supercell’s Clash of Clan game to illustrate how image recognition can be built into the test-automation process.</p>

	<h2><strong>Test Automation Is Perfect For Mobile App Development</strong></h2>

	<p>Developing mobile applications is very different from developing PC software or even embedded software. Mobile development is meant to be agile, and a lot of great tools and practices have been developed for that agility. However, doing something manually — such as testing an app — is never agile, which is why test automation has shown tremendous growth among app and game developers, speeding up their doings and yielding robust and better results.</p>

	<p>To achieve compatibility between users, devices and the market, including test automation as a part of the agile development process is typical. Fortunately, a lot of tools are available, and test automation is a perfect fit for this process. For example, let’s say your typical development sprint is two weeks. You have daily standups and a lot of scrum activities, and you own internal policies that gear development to the final product. <strong>Test automation offers a significant value-add</strong> by enabling testing to be done in parallel — for example, as nightly test sessions. By the next morning, the tests will have been finalized and the results of the latest regression will be ready for review. Fixing an issue earlier will save a lot of time and get developers to finalize the product sooner; most importantly, it cumulates to better quality, with fewer bugs.
