					<p><strong>Actor/comedian Christopher Titus</strong> may be famous among TV viewers for his performance in “Titus” (2000-2002), a semi-autobiographical sitcom based on his real life situation while living with an alcoholic father (portrayed in the show by actor by Stacy Keach). Previously, Titus entertained his live audiences with the one-man show <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Norman-Rockwell-Bleeding-Christopher-Titus/dp/B001a76vza" target="_blank">“Norman Rockwell Is Bleeding”</a> (1998), where he also utilized his dark childhood as material for his performance. In 2004, he revived the stage act on the small screen.

					Titus, who entered show business as a teen, was once the opening act for Kenny Loggins and Michael Bolton. Apart from his funny performances, he also had non-comic roles in films like the TV movie Columbo: Grand Deceptions (1989), “Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman” (1996) and the TV sci-fi crime drama Future Tense (2003). The comedian recently filed for divorce from Erin (1991-2006), with whom he has a daughter and a son.</p>
